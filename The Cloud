Being a student can be difficult! There are many choices you have to make throughout your years of study, but there is one bothering you right now, how can I store my files effectively? It is an important question that has two popular [[answers]]! <img src= "http://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder938/500x/64555938.jpg" "width"= 400 height=400 "alt"=instances> You haven't purchased a laptop yet, you are deciding between the state of the art Asus, it's even compatible with windows 10, or a Mac Book, but that's not the focus of what's on your mind. Now these laptops, as the knowledgeable sales man at best buy assured you, have a large amount of [[internal storage]]! However you wonder will this be enough? You have heard tales of another storage place one that many do not understand and is very elusive, yet very user friendly, that is the [[cloud]]. <img src="https://static.spiceworks.com/shared/post/0007/2340/game_of_thrones_data_loss_meme.jpg "width"=400 "height"=400 "alt"= spiceworks.com"> Ah, so your fear of the unknown got the best of you. That is alright, many folks tend to walk this path tried and true. Although internal storage on a the hard drive has it's perks, such as being able to access and edit your files without internet. However internal storage has a [[dark side]]. <img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/90acf174eedfc59017c4d16cbc424ce2/tumblr_inline_mv4z5ailDv1s850yn.png" "width"= 400 "height"=400 "alt"= tumblr.com>The cloud is a power that most do not understand and are thus afriad to use it, but you have summoned the courage to at least understand it. Now the cloud is also referred to as "cloud computing", meaning you will store your files over the internet. There are [[pros]] and [[cons]] to this method. Now you have learned more about the [[apps]]that use cloud computing. <img src="http://www2.pcmag.com/media/images/417346-back-up-your-cloud-how-to-download-all-your-data.jpg?thumb=y&width=740&height=426" alt="cloud computing"> The hard drive of your laptop has limits, the internet storage capacity does not! A excellent site that utilizes [[cloud]] computing is Google Docs. Google Docs is an excellent choice for you as a student! When typing it automatically saves your work and allows you to collaborate on the same document with other people, this essential for those pesky group projects. (Well as long as your group members actually do the work their assigned!) Many of the other cloud apps allow this to occur as well, we'll get to those shortly. <img src= "http://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/when-i-die-i-want-the-people-i-did-group-projects-with-to-lower-me-into-my-grave-so-they-can-let-me-down-one-last-time-0e740.png" "width"=400 "height"=400 "alt"= someecards.com>The [[cloud]] has one very significant limitation if you live in an area with limited internet access, which in this day and age is ethier the North Pole or the Middle of the Atlantic (I hold no judgement if that is the case). Although many of the cloud apps are now offering offline editing, but if you close the browser none of your work will be saved! However in apps such as Google Docs sometimes malfunctions can occur. In some situations half of the eight page essay that is worth 50% disappears one hour before the deadline, but at that point you're to tired and drained to even care anymore. <img src= "http://d3ltpfxjzvda6e.cloudfront.net/2015/08/14/no_internet_meme.jpg" "width"= 400 "height"=400 "alt"=cloudfront.net>Google Docs is a popular choice by many and is highly recommended for students! Your documents can easily be downloaded into PDF's or Word Docs easily, and then after printing or handing them in online can be deleted from your hard drive. With this app you can create essays, presentations and even spread sheets! This app is extemely versitile and useful for students. The cloud isn't so scary after all eh? Let's look at more [[apps]] <img src= "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/11/2a/48/112a483189c53a9f19d22b729087ecd5.jpg" "width"= 400 "height"=400 "alt"= pinimg.com> The ICloud in the simplest terms, brought to you by techopedia, is "a cloud computing solution by Apple Computer Inc. that provides cloud storage and apps for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. iCloud provides the ability to store documents, videos, photos, music and other data online and the ability to sync it between iOS-powered devices." A very popular choice for iOS cloud users! Lets look at more [[apps]] <img src= "http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/dc/dc111d4e5a2ae36becc50cb490750fdf856672e0d1460063f950a7bc4e876c6a.jpg" "height"= 400 "width"=400 "alt"= quickmeme.com><img src= "http://www.judicalis.org/uploads/7/4/3/5/7435835/5689441_orig.jpg" height="300" width="500" alt= "uploads"> This is a common experience for those using their laptops hard drive for file storage! If your laptop is lost, stolen or just plain crashes on you, that's the end of your files! With the cloud you can access your files from any computer as long as you have interent access! So never fear the cloud is here and has been from the [[Start]]!Now you are pretty sure this cloud doesn't sound so bad, what are those other folks afraid of? Now you have some choices on which apps that utlize cloud computing you'd like to use. One I have mentioned that is very popular and compatiable with almost every computer is [[Google Docs]]! Another option that is [[ICloud]] however this is only compatible with other ios apple products. You have travelled this [[path]] of mystery bravely. <img src= "https://d.justpo.st/media/images/2015/02/600a5067459345870b40c2afbfc5678b.jpg" "width"= "400" height="400" "alt"=justpo.com> I have shown you the path of the cloud now student. Yet you still might be wondering what would have happened if you used [[internal storage]]. <img src= "http://cdn.meme.am/instances/33416901.jpg" "width"=400 "height"=400 "alt"=meme.am>
